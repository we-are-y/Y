Y is a comprehensive system for personal data sovereignty, AI assistance, and value attribution in the digital age.

## üß© Schema Registry & Extensibility

Y uses a dynamic **schema registry** to support any data type, now and in the future. New data types can be described (fields, units, display names, UI hints, etc.) and registered without code changes. This ensures:
- The Vault, Echo, and dashboard adapt automatically
- Developers and users can extend the system with new data sources
- Backward compatibility via versioning

## üí∏ Value Calculation & Vault Score

Y calculates the value of your Vault using a blend of:
- **Demand**: How many requests exist for this data type?
- **Rarity**: Is your data common or unique?
- **Completeness/Quality**: How detailed and well-structured is your data?
- **Freshness**: Is your data recent?
- **Signal Density**: Richness of behavioral/emotional/other signals
- **Streaks & Decay**: Consistent uploads are rewarded, outdated data loses value

Your **Vault Score** and earning potential are shown in the dashboard, along with tips to increase your value.

# üß¨ Y: The Sovereign Interface

**Y is not a product. Y is a direction.**  
A living infrastructure where human beings reclaim ownership of their data, agency over their intelligence, and value from their existence.

---

## ‚ùì What Is Y?

Y is a sovereign operating layer ‚Äî not for your computer, but for your **self**.

It is the system that:
- Stores your life securely (Vault)
- Understands your behaviors (Signal Layer)
- Negotiates access and value (Human & Enterprise API)
- Routes dividends from your contributions (Grid)

Y flips the current data economy:
> From platforms owning people ‚Äî  
> To people owning the platforms.

---

## üß† Why Y Exists

We are approaching the **post-labor world** ‚Äî  
A future where AI, robotics, and automation will replace almost every job humans do today.

In that world, your signal is more valuable than your labor.

But today:
- Humans are reduced to data points.
- Privacy is performative.
- AI systems scale on human input ‚Äî without recognition or compensation.

**Y exists to change that.**  
To make sure humans don't just survive in the age of AI ‚Äî they **thrive**.

---

## üí° What Makes Y Different?

- ‚ùå Y is **not** a marketplace
- ‚ùå Y is **not** a collection of bots
- ‚ùå Y is **not** a passive data vault

- ‚úÖ Y is a **sovereign system**
- ‚úÖ Y is an **intentional architecture for human dignity**
- ‚úÖ Y is a **living interface between self, signal, and society**

It is a radical reframing of value ‚Äî  
Where your *existence* is enough to earn.  
Where your *consent* is real.  
Where your *Vault* is the beginning of everything.

## üß≠ Our Founding Thesis

> If the future makes us unnecessary as workers,  
> Then Y makes us **sacred as people**.

Y doesn't optimize for systems.  
Y optimizes for the **soul**.

---

## üåç What Happens Here

This repository is the **central monorepo** of Y.  
We use it to build, document, and evolve every part of the system.

You'll find:
- Specs
- Architecture
- Agents
- Vault schemas
- API protocols
- Build notes
- Research threads

This is where **human sovereignty becomes code**.

## üõ† Contributing

Currently, development is limited to the founding team.  
Want to help? Start by understanding the [Vault architecture](./vault/) and [Echo design](./echo/), and submit a proposal via `issues`.

## üôè A Note From the Founder

Y was born out of a deep belief:

That when the world stops needing us to work ‚Äî  
we must build a world where we are still needed.  
Not as cogs. But as whole, sovereign humans.

Thank you for being here. We're building the long game.

## üß© Building on Y: Vault-Native Modules, Not Standalone Apps

Y is not a generic developer platform for launching new apps. Instead, Y is a protocol and interface for building Vault-native modules‚Äîtools, dashboards, agents, and plugins that run inside the Vault, the user's trusted home and operating system for their data and intelligence.

**If you're building on Y, you're building for the Vault.**

- All modules run inside the Vault interface
- All modules follow Y's data standards and schema
- All modules respect consent and value-routing protocols
- All modules are reviewed, authenticated, and optionally monetized through Y

**You do not build standalone apps. You build Vault-native modules.**

### Examples of Vault-Native Modules
- Dashboards that visualize health, habits, or learning
- AI agents trained on Vault signal
- Research request layers (with user consent)
- Simulation tools, coaching layers, family views
- Plugins that extend Echo's capabilities

### For Developers: How to Build a Vault-Native Module
1. Register your module with the Vault, specifying its schema, permissions, and UI integration points.
2. Use Y's APIs and schema registry to access and process user data (with consent).
3. Ensure your module respects all consent, value-routing, and privacy protocols.
4. Submit your module for review and authentication.
5. Optionally, monetize your module through Y's value-routing engine.

**All modules are always under user control: visible, revocable, and permissioned.**

‚∏ª

üß© The Golden Rule:

All of these are Vault-native modules, not standalone apps.
They plug into Y's schema, follow the consent + value protocol, and are surfaced inside your interface ‚Äî not theirs.

---

## ‚ùì Protocol vs. Product: What's the Difference?

- **Product:** A finished application or service for end users. (e.g., the Vault app itself)
- **Protocol:** The open rules, APIs, and standards that define how modules interact with data, value, and consent‚Äîinside the Vault.

**Y is a protocol and interface. The Vault is the one app that matters. Everything else is a module that lives inside it.**
