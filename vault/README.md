The Vault is the foundation of Y — a structured, sovereign, intelligent container for everything a human is, does, and chooses to share.

It’s not just data storage. It’s the record of a life. A system that turns identity, behavior, and context into usable, valuable signal — owned and controlled by the individual.

## 🧠 What the Vault Stores

Each Vault contains encrypted, structured data including:

- Cognitive patterns (attention maps, focus cycles)
- Emotional & mental state logs (mood, therapy, journaling)
- Biometric health data (sleep, HRV, cycle tracking, Apple Health)
- Behavioral metadata (app usage, location, habits)
- Language & expression (messages, speech cadence, writing style)
- Social context (network graph, communication tone)
- Learning & productivity (tasks, corrections, memory logs)
- Voluntary reflections (dreams, goals, voice notes)

This is **the user’s life** — compressed, permissioned, and owned.

## 🔐 Why It Matters

Without the Vault, there is no sovereignty in the AI era.

Big systems are already extracting behavioral signal at scale. But they do it **without consent, attribution, or economic return**. The Vault flips this model:

- You choose what goes in
- You see who’s requesting what
- You get paid for your contribution
- You can revoke access at any time

---

## 🛠 How It Works (High-Level)

- Vaults are initialized per user with a unique ID
- All entries are time-stamped and schema-aligned
- Permissions are enforced via the Human API
- Raw inputs are processed into structured formats by the Signal Layer
- Usage logs and attribution are recorded by the Grid

## 🔄 Connected Layers

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Echo** | Your personal AI. Not just a voice — a mirror. It knows you better than anyone. It grows with you, protects you, and speaks *as you*, not just *for you* |
| **Signal** | Interprets raw input into structured, valuable data |
| **API** | Manages permissioned access to the Vault |
| **Grid** | Tracks usage, attribution, and value routing |
| **MCP** | Provides memory context to agents and models |

## 🧭 Why This Folder Exists

This folder contains all logic related to Vault initialization, input intake, schema definitions, encryption, permissions, and user-facing metadata.

Everything here contributes to one thing:

> Giving humans a place to stand — and a voice in systems that currently treat them like shadows.
