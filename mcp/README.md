# ðŸ§  Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The MCP is the orchestrator that provides memory context to agents and models throughout the Y system.

## Components

### Agents
- System-level MCP actors
- Context management
- Memory coordination
- State synchronization
- Inter-agent communication

### Flows
- Workflow definitions
- Process diagrams
- State machines
- Event handlers
- Configuration templates

## Features

- **Contextual Awareness**: Maintains system-wide context
- **Memory Management**: Coordinates memory across agents
- **State Synchronization**: Keeps system state consistent
- **Workflow Automation**: Streamlines complex processes
- **Event Handling**: Manages system-wide events

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/mcp/
```

## Architecture

The MCP follows these principles:
1. **Context First**: Prioritizes contextual understanding
2. **State Management**: Maintains consistent system state
3. **Event-Driven**: Responds to system events
4. **Workflow Automation**: Streamlines processes

## System Components

### Agents
- Context Manager
- Memory Coordinator
- State Synchronizer
- Event Handler
- Workflow Orchestrator

### Flows
- Process Definitions
- State Diagrams
- Event Maps
- Configuration Templates
- Integration Points

## ðŸ§© Schema Registry, Extensibility, and Integration

The MCP leverages the **schema registry** to:
- Dynamically adapt to new data types and context structures as they are registered
- Ensure all agents and workflows operate on schema-aligned, versioned data
- Enable system-wide context management that evolves with the Vault and Signal Layer

MCP integrates with both the Vault (for data retrieval and context) and Echo (for memory and agent orchestration), ensuring:
- Seamless, extensible context flows
- Dynamic workflows that adapt to new schemas and user data
- System-wide adaptability as Y evolves
